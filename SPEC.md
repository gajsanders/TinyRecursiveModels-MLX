Certainly! Here’s your **TinyRecursiveModels-MLX MLX/Apple Silicon Port: Developer-Ready Specification** broken down into detailed, tracked sub-sections for clarity and actionable execution:

***

## 1. Project Overview

**1.1 Objective:**  
Convert the CUDA/NVIDIA codebase to Apple Silicon/MLX-only, optimized for MacOS Sequoia and M4 Max, using test-driven methodology.

**1.2 Scope:**  
- Phase 1: Achieve complete functional parity (all original tests passing on Mac/MLX)
- Phase 2+: Expand features (Chess, Baduk/Go, advanced models) after stable baseline

***

## 2. Supported Platform Matrix

**2.1 Hardware:**  
- Target: Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4 series)
- Reference: M4 Max 128GB MacPro
- Exclude: Intel-based Macs, Linux, Windows

**2.2 OS Requirements:**  
- Minimum: macOS ≥ 13.5 (Ventura)
- Recommended: Sonoma or Sequoia

***

## 3. Architecture Migration

**3.1 CUDA → MLX Porting:**
- Remove/replace CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT dependencies with MLX
- All device and kernel code adapted for MLX’s API
- Swap Linux-specific workflow/tools for macOS-native alternatives

**3.2 Repo Structure and Analysis:**
- Document current dependencies (pip, conda, CUDA libraries)
- Outline original directory/module structure (models, scripts, configs)
- Summarize existing test suite

**3.3 MLX Example/Reference Anchors:**
- Directly link and cite MLX best-practice repos, Apple docs, migration guides

***

## 4. Functional & Nonfunctional Requirements

**4.1 Critical Features:**  
- TRM core model (recursive loop, latent state, answer update)
- All core reasoning tasks (Sudoku, ARC-AGI, maze)
- Baseline training/evaluation pipeline

**4.2 Deferred / Experimental Features:**  
- Model variants (HRM, deep supervision, ACT routines)
- Advanced training (mixed/distributed, checkpointing, model surgery)
- Not strict for initial build; documented in tests as deferred

**4.3 Performance Expectations:**  
- MLX to achieve 10–25% parity with CUDA for main workloads (training/inference)
- Prioritize inference speed and efficiency
- Document limitations (mixed precision, memory pressure, operation/edge-case bottlenecks)

***

## 5. Code Style and Project Organization

**5.1 Standards:**  
- Black formatting, enforced by CI
- PEP8, flake8/isort/pylint for style, mypy for type hints
- Well-documented classes/functions, @dataclass for config/data
- Python 3.9+ ARM-native

**5.2 Directories:**  
- mlx/  – MLX code
- src/  – Shared code (optional)
- tests/ – Full test suite
- docs/ – Documentation, migration notes, FAQ
- examples/ – Scripts, notebooks
- benchmarks/ – Benchmarking code/notebooks
- .github/ – CI workflows, templates

***

## 6. Documentation & Licensing

**6.1 Migration Guide:**  
- Steps taken, rationale, architectural changes, deprecated paths

**6.2 README:**  
- Apple-only setup, dependencies, install steps, troubleshooting (FAQ), usage caveats

**6.3 In-Code Comments:**  
- Major changes, hardware-specific optimizations, device detection, workarounds

**6.4 Attribution/Licensing:**  
- Preserve original author credits in all adapted files
- Note adapted code, borrowed MLX examples, and third-party components
- LICENSE updates and per-component annotations

***

## 7. Data Handling Strategy

**7.1 Bundled Data:**  
- Minimal open sample datasets for tests/examples (`tests/data/`)
- Fast, out-of-box reproducibility

**7.2 Downloaded Data:**  
- Fetchers/scripts for larger, open-license datasets with instruction/caching
- Documented license and source (`data/README.md`)

**7.3 Privacy & Licensing:**  
- No personal/proprietary data
- Only use datasets with proven open-source licensing

***

## 8. Error Handling, Logging, Debugging

**8.1 Logging:**  
- Python logging (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING) to console/files, flag-controlled verbosity

**8.2 Diagnostics:**  
- Device/MLX error reporting, actionable messages at WARNING/ERROR
- Debug mode and developer utilities for hardware detection (`mlx/utils/device_diag.py`)

***

## 9. Packaging and Distribution

**9.1 Installation:**  
- Pip-installable (pyproject.toml preferred), wheel/sdist build artifacts
- Install via source, GitHub, PyPI (optional future), clear scripts/setup guides

**9.2 Versioning:**  
- Semantic versioning, tagged releases, changelog, CI-assisted packaging

***

## 10. Test-Driven Development Plan

**10.1 Phase 1: Test Specification**
- Enumerate all expected behaviors and specs in written test plan

**10.2 Phase 2: Test Suite Skeleton and Data**
- Build pytest scaffolding; stub/failing tests for all features (critical/experimental)
- Bundled/minimal sample datasets, device fixtures, reproducibility utilities

**10.3 Phase 3: Coverage Validation**
- Run coverage analysis, dry fail run, peer review and sign-off
- All code written only to satisfy and pass tests

***

## 11. Benchmarking, Profiling, Reporting

**11.1 Scripts and Notebooks:**  
- Benchmarks comparing MLX/CUDA speeds, inference/training, memory, model load
- Standard metrics: speed (epochs/sec), latency (ms/sample), memory, device info

**11.2 CI Artifacts:**  
- Upload PNG/PDF plots, summary tables, retained historical tracking if possible

**11.3 Contributor Instructions:**  
- docs/benchmarks/README.md for local benchmarks, manual results submission template

***

## 12. Community, Contributions, Maintenance

**12.1 Open Contributions:**
